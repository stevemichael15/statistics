What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n"," -  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects and data rather than functions and logic. It emphasizes concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.\n","\n","2. What is a class in OOP?\n"," - A class is a blueprint or prototype for creating objects in OOP. It defines a set of attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that objects created from the class will have.\n","\n","3. What is an object in OOP?\n"," - An object is an instance of a class. It is a self-contained entity that has properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Objects are the real-world entities in OOP.\n","\n","4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n"," - Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It focuses on \"what an object does.\"\n"," - Encapsulation is the bundling of data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is done through access modifiers (private, public).\n","\n","5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n"," - Dunder methods (also known as magic methods or special methods) are built-in methods in Python that have double underscores before and after their names, such as __init__, __str__, and __add__. They allow custom behavior for operators and function calls.\n","\n","6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n"," - Inheritance is the mechanism in OOP where a new class (subclass) derives or inherits properties and methods from an existing class (superclass). This allows code reuse and the creation of a hierarchy of classes.\n","\n","7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n"," - Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It enables the same method to behave differently depending on the object it is called on.\n","\n","8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n"," - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting access to the object's attributes or methods. This can be done by defining variables and methods as private (using a single or double underscore) and using getter and setter methods to access or modify those variables.\n","\n","9. What is a constructor in Python?\n"," - A constructor is a special method (__init__) in Python that is called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes and set up its initial state.\n","\n","10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n"," - Class method: A method that takes the class itself as the first argument (cls) and can modify the class state. It is defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n"," - Static method: A method that doesn't take any special first argument (not self or cls) and behaves like a regular function within a class. It is defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n","\n","11. What is method overloading in Python?\n"," - Method overloading refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (number or type). Python does not support traditional method overloading, but it can be achieved by using default arguments or variable-length arguments (*args and **kwargs).\n","\n","12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n"," - Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass has the same name, parameters, and signature as the method in the superclass.\n","\n","13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n"," - The @property decorator in Python is used to define a method as a \"getter\" for an attribute. It allows an attribute to be accessed as if it were a simple variable, while still allowing custom logic to be executed when accessing or setting its value.\n","\n","14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n"," - Polymorphism is important in OOP because it allows for flexibility and extensibility in code. It enables objects of different types to be treated uniformly, making code easier to maintain, modify, and extend.\n","\n","15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n"," - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It is defined using the abc module and the ABC base class. It may contain abstract methods, which are methods that must be implemented by subclasses.\n","\n","16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n","- The main advantages of OOP are:\n"," 1. Code Reusability: Through inheritance, classes can be reused in multiple programs.\n"," 2. Modularity: OOP divides programs into smaller, manageable pieces (objects).\n"," 3. Maintainability: Changes in one part of a program have less impact on others.\n"," 4. Encapsulation: OOP restricts access to some components of objects to ensure data integrity.\n"," 5. Flexibility: OOP allows for polymorphism and method overriding, leading to flexible and adaptable systems.\n","\n","17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n"," - Class variable: A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. It is defined within the class but outside of any instance methods. It has the same value for every instance.\n"," - Instance variable: A variable that is unique to each instance of the class. It is defined within instance methods (like __init__), and its value can differ between different instances.\n","\n","18.  What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n"," - Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This enables a class to combine functionalities from multiple sources.\n","\n","19.  Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n","\n"," - __str__: Defines the human-readable string representation of an object. It's called by print() or str().\n"," - __repr__: Provides the official string representation of an object, meant for debugging. It should return a valid Python expression, if possible.\n","20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n"," - super() allows you to call a method from a parent class. It is primarily used in method overriding to call the parent class's version of the overridden method.\n","python\n","Copy code\n","\n","21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n"," - __del__ is a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed (garbage collected). It is used to perform cleanup actions.\n","\n","22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n"," - @staticmethod: A method that does not operate on an instance or class. It is like a regular function within a class.\n"," - @classmethod: A method that operates on the class itself, taking cls as its first argument\n","\n","23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n"," - Polymorphism allows methods in different classes to have the same name but behave differently. With inheritance, subclasses can override parent class methods, enabling dynamic method resolution.\n","\n","24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n"," - Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement by returning self from each method.\n","\n","25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n"," - The __call__ method allows an instance of a class to be called as if it were a function"],"metadata":{"id":"s9RRTJQp-RrM"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 1.
